<h2>Migration in details</h2>
<br/><br/>

Each viewpoint comes with an additional contribution to manage migration of its data. These contributions are used by <i>Capella</i> when the user launch the migration on his model.<br/> 

If a viewpoint <b>requires a migration</b> of its data, the <b>model can't be opened</b> and the following error dialog is displayed:<br/><br/>
 
<img src="images/wrongversion.png"/>
<br/><br/><br/>


<br/><br/>
<h3>Viewpoint version support</h3>
A sanity check is perform before the model is opened to ensure that each used viewpoint is available and in the expected version.<br/><br/>
Version numbers follow the usual eclipse convention: <i>major.minor.micro.qualifier</i>   For example:  1.1.0.20161004114119<br/>
When a viewpoint is updated in the platform, if its version major or minor number is upgraded the existing models will need a migration.
