Perform modifications if needed (e.g. choosing specific locations for the new elements, modifying the suffix) and click on OK. The following Information Dialog details the changes performed by this update.

 
Before Capella 1.0, once the RPL is created, RPL elements with suffix are not synchronized. After Capella 1.0, if the suffix is modified, all elements that are intended to be renamed will be updated to have the name of the corresponding REC element with the new suffix. Similarly, if a REC element was renamed, the corresponding RPL elements will be updated with the new REC name and the current RPL suffix. Also, if an existing element has no suffix but its corresponding REC element was marked as having to be renamed, it will be updated with the RPL suffix.
