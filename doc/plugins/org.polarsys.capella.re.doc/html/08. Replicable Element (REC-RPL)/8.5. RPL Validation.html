		<p>Different kinds of conformance are possible between a RPL and its REC. Capella defines three default kinds of conformance, but end-user can define their own ones.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Blackbox: No modification is allowed on the Replica. Elements of the 	RPL should not be edited, but only connected via existing port and 	interfaces with other elements of the model. 
				<br/> It should not be 	possible to add internal elements, modify the external constraints 	(ports, interfaces) of elements of the RPL.
				<br/>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Constrained Reuse: Internal elements can be added inside a RPL, but 	constraints and Interfaces (Function and Component Ports for 	example) defined in REC cannot be modified.
				<br/>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Inheritance: Any element can be added in the RPL, including new 	Interfaces, ports or functions</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Capella currently provides two different live validation rules for RPL with Blackbox compliance. One rule prevents all modifications on the RPL, the other rule prevents all modifications, unless these modifications are concerning realization links. Both rules are deactivated by default. At most one compliance validation rule per compliancy definition should be active at any time. To enable live validation of RPL with Blackbox compliance, activate one of the two provided rules in the Capella Preferences:</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>If a Blackbox validation rule is active, live validation will occur on all RPL which have the 'Enfore RPL Compliance on the Fly' flag checked in its properties. This flag makes it possible to enable validation for specific RPL only:</p>
		<p>
			<img height="368" width="495" border="0" src="Images/8.5.rplproperties.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>If the live validation detects a violating change, the change is rolled back and an error dialog will open, indicating which changes were not in line with the current compliancy setting of the RPL.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Validation rules for the other two Compliance definitions of the RPL are not available yet </b>
