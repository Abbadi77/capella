Different kinds of conformance are possible between a RPL and its REC. Capella defines three default kinds of conformance, but end-user can define their own ones.

 
* Blackbox: No modification is allowed on the Replica. elements of the 	RPL should not be edited, but only connected via existing port and 	interfaces with other elements of the model. <br> It should not be 	possible to add internal elements, modify the external constraints 	(ports, interfaces) of elements of the RPL.<br>

* Constrained Reuse: Internal elements can be added inside a RPL, but 	constraints and Interfaces (Function and Component Ports for 	example) defined in REC cannot be modified.<br>

* Inheritance: Any element can be added in the RPL, including new 	Interfaces, ports or functions
 
'''Validation rules according to Compliancy of the RPL are not available yet '''
