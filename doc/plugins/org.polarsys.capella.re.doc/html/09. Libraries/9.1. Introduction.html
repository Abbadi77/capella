		<p>A Library is a Capella model intended to be shared between several Projects.</p>
		<p>
			<img height="246" width="533" border="0" src="Images/9.1.%20Introduction_html_65396e1a.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A Project can reference a Library with READ or READ/WRITE mode. In the latter case, this means the Library content can be modified from the Project itself, without having to specifically open the Library.</p>
		<p>A library can have references towards other Libraries, but a Library cannot have a reference towards a Project.</p>
		<p>What are Libraries intended for?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allow reuse of model elements across different models (for example, 	several Projects in one domain often need to share the same data 	model).</li>
			<li>Enhance organization (avoid duplication and references between 	models)</li>
			<li>Host catalogs of Replicable Elements</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Libraries benefit of same tooling than models.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Edition of library&rsquo;s content via diagrams and editors</li>
			<li>Semantic browser</li>
			<li>Validation rules &amp; quick fixes
