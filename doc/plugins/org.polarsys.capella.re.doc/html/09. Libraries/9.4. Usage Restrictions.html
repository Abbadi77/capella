  <h1 id="Usage_Restrictions">Usage Restrictions</h1> 
  <h2 id="Libraries_Usage_Restriction">Libraries Usage Restriction</h2> 
  <ul> 
   <li>In Orchestra 5.4, using Libraries with Melody Team or Melody Connector is supported.</li> 
   <li>Try to open a model (library or project) while one of its referenced libraries is not present in the workspace is not possible. <br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If you want to use a project without referenced libraries you can use the Detach tool to remove references of missing libraries</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Downgraded use cases are not properly supported. Please be aware of the constraints described in the following section.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> <br /> <br /> </p> 
  <h2 id="Nominal_Case_vs_Downgraded_Case">Nominal Case vs Downgraded Case</h2> 
  <p>Violation of one of these rules might shift the user into downgraded use cases:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Replace a library by another version while a referencing project is opened (for instance through an update from Clearcase)</li> 
   <li>Perform a fragmentation or an unfragmentation of a library while a referencing project is opened.</li> 
   <li>Perform action that creates a reference between two objects from different models M1, M2 (project or library) where M2 is referencing M1. For instance, if a project is referencing a library, create a generalization from a class in the library to a class in the project. Such a situation can be obtained when moving graphically elements between diagrams. Future version of Capella will provide an automatic check to prevent such a situation. <br /> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>See <i>prod00125911:</i> <i>Provides an automatic check to detect inter-model references that break library references</i> and <i>prod00125461: Provide a way to roll back modification in case the library is modified with cycles (opposite dependency)</i>. </p> 
  <p> <br /> <br /> </p> 
  <h2 id="Use_Cases_Changes_between_Melody_Advance_3.0_and_4.0">Use Cases Changes between Melody Advance 3.0 and 4.0</h2> 
  <ul> 
   <li>In Melody Advance 4.0, working sessions on models are now fully separated 
    <ul> 
     <li>In Melody Advance 3.0.x, <br /> </li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If you had a session opened on a library and another session opened on a project referencing the same library, a modification made on an element on session of the library will automatically appears on the element appearing in the session of the project, even if you hadn’t save your library. <br /> For instance, if you had renamed an interface in the session of the library, the interface from the library in session of the project will be automatically renamed. </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> 
    <ul> 
     <li>In Capella 4.0.x, sessions are now separated, and modifications made on a library will not appear on the project until session library is saved.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul>
