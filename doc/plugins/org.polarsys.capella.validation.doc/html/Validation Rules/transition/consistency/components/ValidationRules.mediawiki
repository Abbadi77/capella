|This rule ensures consistency for a port allocation between a ComponentPort and a Functional Port realizing a port allocation from a previous level. The ComponentPort should realize the ComponentPort of the realized PortAllocation or should be a delegated port of the realizing port. The FunctionPort should be defined in a function or a sub-function realizing the function containing the port which has been realized.
