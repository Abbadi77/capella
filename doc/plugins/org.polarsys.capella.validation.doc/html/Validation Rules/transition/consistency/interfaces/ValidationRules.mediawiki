|This rule checks that an ExchangeItemElement isn't linked to a Type from a previous level whereas it is realized in the same level than the ExchangeItemElement. ExchangeItemElement should be linked to the realized Type. A warning can be raised if you have performed a transition of the ExchangeItemElement before performing a transition of the linked Type. You should perform another transition of the ExchangeItemElement from the lower level to use the realized Type

|This rule checks that an Interface isn't linked to an ExchangeItem from a previous level whereas it is realized in the same level than the Interface. A warning can be raised if you have performed a transition of the Interface before performing a transition of the allocated ExchangeItem. You should perform another transition of the Interface from the lower level to use the realized ExchangeItem.  Interface should be linked to the realized ExchangeItem.
