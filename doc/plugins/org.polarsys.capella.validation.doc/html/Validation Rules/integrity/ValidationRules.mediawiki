|NOTE: This constraint is replaced by "I_19 - Name conflict" and thus disabled by default.  This rule checks that an element doesn't contain a naming conflict. Usually this means that two elements in the same container cannot have the same name, e.g. one cannot create two classes in a package and assign them identical names. Below we list the special cases:  ExchangeItems Two exchange items that share a common container have conflicting names if both have the same name, and the order, number and type of their ExchangeItemElements is identical.
