| '''Description'''
| '''Default'''
|-
| '''Name'''
| The name of the current Element.
| &lt;generic name&gt;
|-
| '''Summary'''
| A short headline about the role of the current Element.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Pre Condition'''
| Textual description of the conditions necessary for the Capability to be performed. No further exploitation of this description is done in Capella tooling.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Post Condition'''
| Textual description of the conditions verified after the Capability has been performed. No further exploitation of this description is done in Capella tooling.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Inheritance'''
| One or several System Capabilities from which the current System Capability is a specialization.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Involved Functions'''
| The list of System Functions which are particularly relevant in the context of the current System Capability. This list is automatically populated when System functions are created on dataflow diagrams owned by the current Capability. The list can also be enriched manually.  
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Involved Functional Chains'''
| The list of Functional Chains illustrating the current System Capability. This list is automatically populated when Functional Chains are created on dataflow diagrams owned by the current Capability or when a Functional Chain is directly created under the current Capability. The list can also be enriched manually.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Available in Modes and States'''
| The list of Modes and States in which the current System Capability is active.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Realized Capabilities'''
| One or several Operational Capabilities from which the current System Capability is a refinement.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Involved Actors'''

== Description==

This field contains the business description of the current element. Links towards other model elements or diagrams can be created in this description using the &quot;Add Link&quot; button.

By default this field in read-only, so that hyperlinks can be navigated. To start editing the description, click first on the &quot;Edit&quot; button at the very left side of the toolbar.

| '''Field'''
| '''Description'''
| '''Default'''
|-
| '''Applied Property Values'''
| One or several Property Values related to the current Element. These Property Values might be located right under the current Element or anywhere else in the Model.
The "browse" button allows associating an already existing Property Value (not necessarily located under the current Element). The "cross" button allows removing the association between the selected Property Value and the current Element. This action does not delete the Property Value itself.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Applied Property Value Group'''
| One or several Property Value Groups related to the current Element. These Property Values Group and the Property Values they contain might be located right under the current Element or anywhere else in the Model.
The "browse" button allows associating an already existing Property Group (not necessarily located under the current Element). The "cross" button allows removing the association between the selected Property Value and the current Element. This action does not delete the Property Value itself.

| Specifies whether this element is exposed to the Documentation Generation tool.
| True
