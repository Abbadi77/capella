= FAST LINKER VIEW =
 
== INTRODUCTION ==
 
The Fast Linker View enables to create links between elements of the opened Capella Model.

== HOW TO PUT A MODEL ELEMENT IN THE FAST LINKER? ==
 
There are several ways to send elements in the Fast Linker:
* Drag &amp; Drop from viewers (Capella Project Explorer, Semantic Browser),
* Contextual menu (Viewers and Diagrams), with the &ldquo;Send to Fast Linker View&rdquo; command, <br>	 [[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_44c9048d.png|329x164px]]
* F6 shortcut (Viewers and Diagrams).
 
== LINK CREATION PROCEDURE ==
 
The following things happen when the user put an element in the Fast Linker:
* If the Fast Linker is empty, it checks whether this element can be part of a link (as source or target),
** If no link is possible, the Fast Linker rejects the model element,
** If at least one link is possible, the Fast Linker accepts the model element and it becomes visible in the Fast Linker view,
* If the Fast Linker already contains one element, it gets the links between both elements (whatever which is source or target),
** If no link is possible, the Fast Linker rejects the model element (the first model element is leaved untouched),
** If one link is possible, it is created,
** If several links are possible, a menu is displayed to allow the user to make a choice: <br>	 [[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m77521b19.png|300x277px]]
* Once a link is created, a message is added in the Information View: <br>	 [[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m302607fc.png|380x186px]]
* If a model element is once again put in the Fast Linker, the procedure restarts as if the Fast Linker was empty.
 
== ADDITIONAL FEATURES ==
 
The Fast Linker offers some features to ease its usage:
* A clear command ([[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m46b0819d.png|16x16px]]),
* A pin command ([[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m6358d111.png|30x17px]]) allowing to keep an element in the Fast Linker in order to create several links involving it,
** There is two ways to pin an element:
*** Select it in the Fast Linker view and then click on the pin button,
*** Use the drop down menu of the pin button and select the element to pin:<br> [[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m3bb8b649.png|242x223px]] <br> 
** The pinned element is displayed in bold,
** The same procedures can be used to unpin a pinned element.
 
== MULTIPLE SELECTION ==
 
The Fast Linker view supports multiple sources and multiple targets to create links between each couple of source and target when possible.

* This feature is not yet implemented for every link but works with classes associations and generalizations.
* Note that multiple sources can have only one target for a generalization link.
