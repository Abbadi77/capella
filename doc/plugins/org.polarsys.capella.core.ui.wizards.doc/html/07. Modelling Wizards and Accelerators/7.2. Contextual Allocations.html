	<h1 id="CONTEXTUAL_ALLOCATIONS">CONTEXTUAL ALLOCATIONS</h1>
	<p>A specific dialog can be called contextually to one or several
		elements in order to manage their allocations to other elements.</p>

	<p>Possible allocations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Operational Activities to Operational Entities /
				Actors</b> (allocation relationship)</li>
		<li><b>Functions to Actor / System / Components</b> (allocation
			relationship)</li>
		<li><b>Exchange Items to Interfaces</b> (reference relationship)</li>
		<li><b>Functional Exchanges to Component Exchanges</b>
			(allocation relationship)</li>
		<li><b>Physical Component Parts to Physical Component Parts</b>
			(deployment relationship)</li>
	</ul>

		id="EXAMPLE:_ALLOCATION_OF_ACTIVITIES_AND_FUNCTIONS_TO_ENTITIES.2C_ACTORS.2C_COMPONENTS">EXAMPLE:
		ALLOCATION OF ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS TO ENTITIES, ACTORS, COMPONENTS</h2>
	<p>Most of the time, allocating a Function to a Component is
		achieved through an architecture diagram or through the Component
		Editor.</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>The allocation can also be performed the other way round: by
		opening a contextual dialog on a Function or Activity, all possible
		Components proposed (according to the current engineering phase:
		Entities, Actors, System, Logical Components, Physical Components).
		This command is available both from the Project Explorer and the
		Diagrams.</p>
	<p>One of the main advantage of this contextual allocation dialog
		is that is allows selecting several Functions / Activities at once and
		allocate them to the selected element.</p>
