	</p>
	<h3 id="Reuse_mode">Reuse mode</h3>
	<p>In the palette of the interface scenario, select &ldquo;Sequence
		Message with Return Branch&rdquo;, and create one message from
		&ldquo;System&rdquo; to &ldquo;Actor 2&rdquo;. By default, no
		selectable elements are proposed because there are no complete
		communications defined between these two components.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="68" width="340" border="0"
			src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_20372dd4.png" />
	</p>
	<p>Uncheck the filter option &ldquo;Restrict to existing static
		communication compatibilities&rdquo;. The wizard proposes now several
		partial communications:</p>
	<p>
		<img height="189" width="554" border="0"
			src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_m1bb276f1.png" />
	</p>
	<p>All these communications are compatible with the message under
		creation. Set message kind to &ldquo;Asynchronous call &rdquo;.
		Selectable communications change to satisfy compatibility. Both
		communication with interfaces disappear (&ldquo;method1&rdquo; and
		&ldquo;method2&rdquo;) and value of sender link protocols switch to
		&ldquo;ASYNCHRONOUS&rdquo; for both communications with CLs.</p>

	<p>Go back to &ldquo;Synchronous call&rdquo; value. Select
		&ldquo;method1&rdquo; under interface &ldquo;Interface3&rdquo; and
		click on &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;. A new message is displayed in the
		interface scenario. In the interface diagram, new Use link between

	<p>Try to create another message with return between the same
		components. We can notice that the wizard proposes both
		&ldquo;method1&rdquo; and &ldquo;method2&rdquo; by default with the
		filter option &ldquo;Restrict to existing static communication
		compatibilities&rdquo; activated since there exists now a complete
		communication by interfaces between this pair of components.</p>
	<p>In the palette of the interface scenario, select &ldquo;Sequence

		&ldquo;System&rdquo;. Deactivates filter option &ldquo;Restrict to

		Set the name of the interface to &ldquo;MyInterface&rdquo; and click
		on &ldquo;Finish&rdquo; to create the message. In the interface
		diagram, deactivate the filter &ldquo;Hide technical Interface&rdquo;
		and use the &ldquo;insert/remove interface&rdquo; tool in the palette
		to display &ldquo;MyInterface&rdquo;. Use and implements links has
		been created so that a communication with technical interface
		&ldquo;MyInterface&rdquo; is established between &ldquo;Actor 2&rdquo;
		and &ldquo;System&rdquo;. Communication with CLs has been also
		completed (creation of the &ldquo;SEND&rdquo; link). <img height="301"

	</p>
	<p>Try to create another message without return between Actor2 and

		&ldquo;Hide the Name of Technical Interfaces&rdquo; to see it.
		Activate the filter option &ldquo;Show other Exchange Items&rdquo;.
		Three new items appears.</p>

	<p>In the interface diagram, use the &ldquo;insert/remove
