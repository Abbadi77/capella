	<p>Capella Function Port and EI Allocation tool provides means
		manage Function / Port / Exchange Item traceability and allocations
		between two engineering phases.</p>
	<p>With this tool a user can perform Exchange item allocation from
		one or several functions located in the source engineering phase to
		other functions in the following engineering phase, by launching a
		dedicated wizard via the &ldquo;Function Port and EI Traceability
		Wizard&rdquo; command of the contextual menu (see the following
		figure).</p>

	<p>The left pane of the following wizard represent all elements to

	<p>In the above figure, the Function &ldquo;LogicalFunction

	</p>
	<h3 id="Target_Engineering_Phase_.28TEP.29">Target Engineering

		<li>All displayed SEP Ports without one traceability link coming
			from the TEP is shown to user with RED color.</li>
		<li>When an Exchange Item allocated to one Port FP located in the
			SEP is not allocated to at least one of the port realization in the
			TEP, the Exchange Item line will be displayed with red color in the
			left pane.</li>
		<li>When a Function or Function Port is selected in the left
			pane, the tracing elements in the right pane are highlighted.</li>
		<li>A user can drag and drop all displayed Exchange Items from
			left to right or from right to left pane.</li>
		<li>When performing drag and drop of Exchange Item allocations
			from a SEP Port to a TEP Port, a traceability link between the two
			Ports is created automatically if it does not exist yet</li>
		<li>All elements displayed in the wizard can be shown in Capella
			Explorer or Semantic Browser by using a contextual menu &ldquo; Show

				<li>The wizard provides a contextual menu to create a new Input
					Port under an existing Function (see the following figure).</li>
				<li>The wizard provides a contextual menu to create a new

				<li>User can create a traceability link between selected

					<ul>
						<li>User can create a multiple link from TEP to SEP by
