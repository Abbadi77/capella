Descriptor may contains the required information that fulfill your needs about representations without have to load the content of the representation and can also be used to store information about it.</p><p>Please also refer to Capella Release Notes.</p><h2 id="Diagram_extensions">Diagram extensions</h2><h3 id="Expressions_in_.odesigns">Expressions in .odesigns</h3><p>For performance reasons, when writing expressions in .odesigns it is recommended to:
<ul>
<li>Use Java services,</li>
<li>Use AQL expressions,</li>
<li>Not use Acceleo 2 expressions (Acceleo 2 is deprecated).</li>
</ul></p><h3 id="Semantic_Candidate_Expression">Semantic Candidate Expression</h3><p>This expression called at each diagram refresh should be the most efficient possible. It can be computed based on the displayed graphical elements using the variable *diagram*. When 'Import Mapping' are used, please ensure that semantic candidate expression has been updated accordingly to the semantic candidate expression of the imported mapping</p><h3 id="Create_Generic_Viewpoints">Create Generic Viewpoints</h3><p>Create Generic Viewpoints using:</p><ul><li>Sirius capability to extends several diagrams at one time with regular expressions extensions </li><li>Diagram Styles Customization Feature allowing to customize the style of elements based on expression. (for instance, on all "Functions called 'Deprecated'", set color as gray)</li></ul><h2 id="Avoid_EObject.eResource_calls">Avoid EObject.eResource calls</h2><p>On EObject, you have to avoid as much as possible calls to eObject.eResource()</p><h2 id="Contribute_an_ID_handler">Contribute an ID handler</h2><p>If your metamodel elements doesn't inherit from org.polarsys.capella.common.data.modellingcore.ModelElement, you have to contribute an Id handler via the extension point "org.polarsys.capella.shared.id.handler.IdHandler"
You can simply extend the org.polarsys.capella.shared.id.handler.AbstractIdHandler.</p></body></html>
