= Capella PROPERTIES VIEW =
 
== INTRODUCTION ==
 
The Properties View is the place where the characteristics of each Capella elements are entered and displayed. This view is synchronized with the current selection on the diagram or in the project explorer.

'''Capella Editors are also available as dialogs''', accessed with a double-click on any element. The content is exactly the same as in the Properties Views.

Capella editors contain 4 sections: semantic properties, description, extensions, management.

== Capella SECTION (SEMANTIC PROPERTIES) ==
 
This section displays the most important semantic information about the current element. It also allows defining relationships between elements.

== DESCRIPTION SECTION ==
 
The Descriptions section allows editing html descriptions for model elements.

By default the Description field is in read mode, so that hypertext links can be navigated. To start editing the Description, click on the Edit button.

Insertion of hypertext links to other model elements, existing diagrams or URLs are possible using the dedicated button of the toolbar.

Clicking on diagram hyperlinks opens the referenced diagram.

== EXTENSIONS SECTION ==
 
The Extensions section allows defining which Property Values apply to the current element. Explicitly setting this relationship is useful when applied Property Values are not contained by the current element.

For example, one could imagine storing all the non functional properties of all elements in thematic packages (safety, performance, human factors, etc.) instead of having these properties spread all over the model.

Capella properties are also available in dialog boxes, using a double-click on elements in the diagrams. The Capella properties are a simplified version of the Eclipse ones.

== MANAGEMENT SECTION ==
 
The Management section contains non semantic information about the current element.
