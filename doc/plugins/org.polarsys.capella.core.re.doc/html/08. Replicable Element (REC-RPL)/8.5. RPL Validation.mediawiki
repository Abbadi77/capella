= VALIDATION OF RPL =
 
== COMPLIANCY OF RPL ==
 
Different kinds of conformance are possible between a RPL and its REC. Capella defines three default kinds of conformance, but end-user can define their own ones.

* Blackbox: No modification is allowed on the Replica. elements of the RPL should not be edited, but only connected via existing port and interfaces with other elements of the model.<br>
It should not be possible to add internal elements, modify the external constraints (ports, interfaces) of elements of the RPL.
* Constrained Reuse: Internal elements can be added inside a RPL, but constraints and Interfaces (Function and Component Ports for example) defined in REC cannot be modified.
* Inheritance: Any element can be added in the RPL, including new Interfaces, ports or functions
 
'''Validation rules according to Compliancy of the RPL are not available yet '''
