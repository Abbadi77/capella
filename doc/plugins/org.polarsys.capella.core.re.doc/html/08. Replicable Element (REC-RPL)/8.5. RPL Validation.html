	<h2 id="COMPLIANCY_OF_RPL">COMPLIANCY OF RPL</h2>
	<p>Different kinds of conformance are possible between a RPL and
		its REC. Capella defines three default kinds of conformance, but
		end-user can define their own ones.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Blackbox: No modification is allowed on the Replica. elements
			of the RPL should not be edited, but only connected via existing port
			and interfaces with other elements of the model.<br />
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It should not be possible to add internal elements, modify the
		external constraints (ports, interfaces) of elements of the RPL.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Constrained Reuse: Internal elements can be added inside a
			RPL, but constraints and Interfaces (Function and Component Ports for
			example) defined in REC cannot be modified.</li>
		<li>Inheritance: Any element can be added in the RPL, including
			new Interfaces, ports or functions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Validation rules according to Compliancy of the RPL are not
			available yet </b>
