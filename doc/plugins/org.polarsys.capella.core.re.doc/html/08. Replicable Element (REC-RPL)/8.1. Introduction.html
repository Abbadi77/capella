	<p>Replicable Elements are mechanisms allowing the easy reuse of
		model parts.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A <b>Replicable Elements Collection (REC)</b> is a definition
			of an element / set of elements which can be used in multiple
			contexts / configurations / models.
		</li>
		<li>A <b>Replica (RPL)</b> is a use (instantiation) of a
			Replicable Elements Collection in a given context / configuration /
			model.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A REC can be viewed as a &ldquo;contract&rdquo; to which all its
		RPLs must comply. REC can embed RPLs of other RECs.</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>REC and RPL are located in Catalogs</b>. Technically, REC and RPL
		are technical objects pointing towards the list of the elements they
		embed.
	</p>
	<p>Capella provides tooling to manage the creation of REC and their
		instantiation, as well as update mechanisms (from REC to RPL and from
		RPL to REC) and validation rules.</p>

	</p>
	<p>Different kinds of conformance are possible between a RPL and
		its REC. Capella defines three default kinds of conformance, but
		end-user can define their own ones.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Blackbox: No modification is allowed on the Replica.</li>
		<li>Constrained Reuse: Internal elements can be added inside a
			RPL, but constraints and Interfaces (Function and Component Ports for
			example) defined in REC cannot be modified.</li>
		<li>Inheritance: Any element can be added in the RPL, including
			new Interfaces.</li>
	</ul>
