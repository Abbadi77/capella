== MANAGEMENT OF COMPOSITION REC-RPL ==
 
We are going to see how to use libraries and REC-RPL composition in order to create a set of elements based on library elements and data types through an example.

# Create a library to define the data types and elements types <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_2284e832.png|676x159px]] <br>											 For this example, we call it '''lib_cps''' to express it's a library dedicated to define some components. <br> 
# Add some data types and create a physical node component '''Board''' containing the following physical attributes <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_62ca2f9f.png|187x97px]][[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m233d6be5.png|174x93px]] <br>
# In the tree, select the component '''Board''', choose ''''REC / RPL &gt; Create a REC from selection'''' <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_fecc182.png|660x176px]] <br>  											 In the REC creation window, the component and its children are automatically added to the REC. <br> Notice the message &quot;REC have references to external elements&quot;, an additional window shows the elements that will not be instantiated in the destination model. Any RPL of the to be created REC Board will be linked to these elements <br> Remark: it is possible to add these external elements in the REC by pressing the button [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_c388e3a.png|24x20px]] and selecting them. In that case, these elements will be considered as &ldquo;part of&rdquo; the created REC and any RPL will have its own data types. <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_7759190e.png|822x603px]] <br> 											 Now we are going to create a Rack compound by two replicas of Board. <br> 
# Create a physical node component '''Rack''' <br> 	 [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m52755ad8.png|160x85px]] <br>
# In the tree, right click on '''Rack''' and choose '''REC/RPL &gt; Instantiate a RPL from a REC''' <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_25459aa1.png|656x176px]] <br> 											 Then select '''REC_Board''' and add the suffix _1 and validate twice with no modifications. <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m5a8a33fd.png|546x632px]] <br>										 Repeat the operation another time to create a second '''Board''' on the '''Rack''' <br>								 Remark: is it possible to place the newly created RPL into the directory '''REC Catalog / RPL''' to ease the reading of the model. <br>										 [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m5a294393.png|250x139px]] <br>										 Notice the message &quot;REC have references to external elements&quot;, the button trigger an additional window allowing to select from the elements linked to the REC elements which elements will be linked to elements of the RPL. <br>
# In the tree, right click on '''Rack''' and choose ''''REC/RPL &gt; Create a REC from selection&rsquo; ''' <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m7754385b.png|713x206px]] <br>	 [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m1d2fb26.png|534x617px]]
# Two choices are possible to create the REC Rack:
## Simple REC linked to all elements viewed in the wizard, which will happen by clicking directly on OK (same process than REC Board creation, not detailed below)
### Pro: Simple way to create a REC
### Con: If Board is more complicated than a self-contained component, (allocated functions, interfaces), some elements will not be included if they weren&rsquo;t selected when creating the REC_Rack, even if they are part of an existing RPL.
### Con: If Board evolves by adding other elements, these elements will not be added automatically to the REC_Rack and its RPL. You will have to update manually REC_Rack to include these new elements.
## Compound REC, where REC Rack is only a Component Rack with two Replica of Board (whatever elements are included in Board) (detailed below)
### Pro: all elements of a Replica of Board will be included automatically, even if REC_Board is updated <br>				 For both '''Board''', select the related RPL like below. In the main dialog, RPL are added and components Board are now colored in purple, meaning that a related RPL have been added to the REC. These elements will be also added at RPL instanciation <br>												 [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_b1a38c3.png|1040x756px]] <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m4e31a690.png|1015x756px]] <br>											 At end of the wizard, created '''REC_Rack''' is linked to the Rack and both RPL of '''Board''' <br>	 [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_7b1766c3.png|303x140px]] <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m793c1829.png|421x154px]] <br>
# In a model with dependencies to the '''lib_cps''':<br>	 [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m6ec962dc.png|262x306px]] <br>										 Create a RPL of the '''REC_Rack''' in Physical System <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m1eb7c6e0.png|694x206px]] <br> [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_4b18a5c9.png|530x612px]] <br>
In the model, a component Rack has been created and two RPL of boards. <br>
[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_3dbc82aa.png|220x247px]] <br>
''Note: There is no component Board created. Both replica should have been created and initialized after the instantiation of the RPL_Rack. This is a current limitation of the tooling, but it should not be the case''. <br>
For both RPL of Board, an &ldquo;Update selected RPL from its REC&rdquo; must be triggered. Once these Board have been initialized, another &ldquo;Update selected RPL from its REC&rdquo; on the RPL_Rack can be necessary if there is elements linking the two Board. (which is not the case here) <br>
[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_3cc99ac0.png|245x70px]] [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m1e59d7b.png|628x123px]] <br>
We have now a full RPL of Rack <br>

== Promotion of a REC to a library ==
 
From elements of a model, it would be possible to create a REC into a referenced library. <br>
Elements will be copied into the library and become a REC and initial selected elements will be considered as a RPL of the REC stored in the library. <br>
