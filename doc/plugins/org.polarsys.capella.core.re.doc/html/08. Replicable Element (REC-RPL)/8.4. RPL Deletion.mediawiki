= Deletion OF RPL =
 
Different deletion mechanisms are available for a RPL.

* '''Delete RPL and related model elements''': this command allows deleting a RPL as well as the list of elements it embeds.
* '''Delete RPL but preserve related model elements''': this command allows deleting a RPL without deleting the list of elements it embeds.
 
== DELETE RPL AND RELATED MODEL ELEMENTS ==
 
Right click on a RPL, a RPL instance or an element embedded in the RPL. In this example the RPL is pointing towards a list of two physical components and a physical function.
