  <h1 id="Diagram_Preferences">Diagram Preferences</h1> 
  <p>By default, “ <b>Automatic Refresh</b>” is set to true (see the Eclipse Window / Preferences / Viewpoint page): this means diagrams always display the latest state of the model. There are at least two cases where it is recommended to rely on manual rather than automatic refresh: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>When diagrams size grows, it might be necessary to disable automatic refresh in order to improve performance. In that case, new calculated elements can be displayed on a diagram by performing a manual refresh through the specific toolbar Refresh button or by reopening the diagram.</li> 
   <li>When several users collaborate on the same model using Clearcase or SVN.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>“ <b>Do refresh on representation opening</b>” specifies whether a refresh is systematically performed when opening a diagram. Unless working in a collaborative environment with Clearcase or SVN, this option should be set to True. </p> 
  <p>The option “ <b>Always create a aird fragment on control</b>” should always be activated. It allows keeping the model and representation files fragmented accordingly. </p> 
  <p> <i>The two other options in this page are irrelevant in the context of Capella.</i> </p>

  <p>The “ <b>Viewpoint Diagram</b>” subsection contains a set of preferences specifically related to diagrams. </p>
