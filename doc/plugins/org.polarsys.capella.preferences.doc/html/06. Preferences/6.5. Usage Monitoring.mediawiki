This preference is related to the logger "Usage Monitoring". This logger is aimed to track Capella usage (Project creation, Diagram creation, ...) then generate tracking informations into a log file named "Usage.log".<br>
By default, this file is generated into the current workspace. However the file location can be set in the eclipse.ini configuration file as following :

 -DUsagePath=D:\APP\<UsagePath>

''' Note :''' This preference is deactivated by default.
