= How to Rename a Capella Project? =

The first step is to close the session in case it is opened.

Then, the following sequence must be respected:

* On the Capella project, use F2 (or contextual menu “Rename”): this action will rename the folder of the project and modify the “.project” file inside this folder ;

* On the “.melodymodeller” file, type F2 (or contextual menu “Rename”): this action will rename the “.melodymodeller” file, the Project root element of the model and update all references from the “.aird” files to the “.melodymodeller” file ;

* On the “.aird” file, type F2 (or contextual menu “Rename”): this action will rename the “.aird” file ;

<u>Note:</u> The same process can be applied on Libraries projects.
