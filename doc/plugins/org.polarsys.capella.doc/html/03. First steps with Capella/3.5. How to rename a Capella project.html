		Capella Project?</h1>
	<p>The first step is to close the session in case it is opened.</p>
	<p>Then, the following sequence must be respected:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On the Capella project, use F2 (or contextual menu “Rename”):
			this action will rename the folder of the project and modify the
			“.project” file inside this folder ;</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>On the “.melodymodeller” file, type F2 (or contextual menu
			“Rename”): this action will rename the “.melodymodeller” file, the
			Project root element of the model and update all references from the
			“.aird” files to the “.melodymodeller” file ;</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>On the “.aird” file, type F2 (or contextual menu “Rename”):
			this action will rename the “.aird” file ;</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<u>Note:</u> The same process can be applied on Libraries projects.
