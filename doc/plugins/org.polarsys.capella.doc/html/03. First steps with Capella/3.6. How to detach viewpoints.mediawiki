= HOW TO DETACH VIEWPOINTS FROM A CAPELLA PROJECT? =
 
Since version 2.4.0, Capella enforces the presence of all the Viewpoints used by a project. Thus it is mandatory to install all these Viewpoints in Capella in order to migrate or to open a project.
 
When all the Viewpoints previously used by the project are installed in the Capella target version, the migration will work as expected. In this scenario, the Detachment tool is not needed.
 
If the Viewpoints are not available nor installed in the Capella target version, a preparation of the project is needed before the migration will be possible.
 
Two cases can be faced.

== The Viewpoints are available and installed in the source version ==
 
In this case, it&rsquo;s recommended to :
 
* Open the project in the Capella source version of the project.
* Deselect all the unavailable viewpoints of the target version, by using the &ldquo;Viewpoint Selection&rdquo; contextual menu.
* Save the project.
* Uninstall the Viewpoints from the Capella installation.
* Launch the Detachment tool by using the &ldquo;Viewpoint Detachment&rdquo; contextual menu.

Click on &ldquo;Analyze&rdquo; button to navigate the project model and list all unknown elements.
 
If some unknown elements are detected, they will be listed and the &ldquo;Remove button&rdquo; will be available. This action will remove all the unknown elements and Viewpoints from the project.
