The archive of the Project will be extracted inside the Workspace (i.e. the physical location of the imported will be the same as the location of the Workspace).
 
When choosing &ldquo;Select Root Directory&rdquo;, the following dialog box opens:

For each project in the selected directory, one can select whether the Project should be copied within the Workspace or not.
 
When choosing the copy option:
 
* The original Project will be duplicated in the file system
* Modifications will be applied on the copy inside the Workspace and not on the original Project files (see documentation about relationships between Projects and Workspaces).
 
Click on Finish. The selected projects are opened in the current workspace.
