	<h1 id="Introduction_to_Capella">Introduction to Capella</h1>
	<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>Much more than just yet another modelling tool, Capella is a
		model-based engineering solution that has been successfully deployed
		in a wide variety of industrial contexts. Based on a graphical
		modelling workbench, it provides systems, software and hardware
		architects with rich methodological guidance relying on Arcadia, a
		comprehensive model-based engineering method.</p>
	<p>Ensure engineering-wide collaboration by sharing the same
		reference architecture Master the complexity of systems and
		architectures Define the best optimal architectures through trade-off
		analysis Master different engineering levels and traceability with
		automated transition and information refinement</p>
	<h2 id="A_graphical_modeling_workbench_...">A graphical modeling
		workbench ...</h2>
	<p>The Capella workbench is an Eclipse application implementing the
		Arcadia method providing both a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and
		toolset which is dedicated to guidance, productivity and quality.
		Intuitive model editing and viewing capabilities help engineers focus
		on the design and description of the system and its architecture.</p>
	<h2 id="..._dedicated_to_efficient_architectural_design">...
		dedicated to efficient architectural design</h2>
	<p>The capabilities of Capella focus on helping engineers design
		better architectures through:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An embedded methodology browser</li>
		<li>Advanced mechanisms to manage complexity through computed
			simplifications and abstractions</li>
		<li>Productivity tools including:
			<ul>
				<li>Model-to-model transformations</li>
				<li>Capitalization through patterns</li>
				<li>Libraries of replicable elements</li>
				<li>Layout brushing</li>
				<li>System to subsystem transition, etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Native support for viewpoint extensions using Kitalpha
			(PolarSys solution) and Sirius (Eclipse component)</li>
		<li>An ability to extend and/or specialize the core environment
			with feature plugins to address particular engineering concerns (e.g.
			performance, operating safety, cost, mass, product line, etc.) and
			carry out multi-criteria analyses of target architectures to find the
			best trade-offs.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="A_method-driven_DSL">A method-driven DSL</h2>
	<p>The Arcadia/Capella DSL is inspired by UML/SysML and NAF
		standards, and shares many concepts with these languages. It is the
		result of an iterative definition process driven by systems and
		software architects working in a broad spectrum of business domains
		(transportation, avionics, space, radar, etc.).</p>
	<p>The Arcadia/Capella DSL enforces an approach structured on
		successive engineering phases which establishes clear separation
		between needs (operational need analysis and system need analysis) and
		solutions (logical and physical architectures), in accordance with the
		IEEE 1220 standard. Arcadia and Capella cover all aspects of standard
		architecture modelling in each engineering phase including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Capability-driven model organization with scenarios and
			functional chains</li>
		<li>Functional analysis and allocation to components and
			resources</li>
		<li>Interfaces, bit-precise data models, behaviours, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="Capella_big_picture">Capella big picture</h2>
	<p>Capella fits into a wider engineering landscape, as bridges can
		be developed to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Initialize Capella models from upstream engineering outputs
			(typically coming from Architecture Frameworks such as NAF)</li>
		<li>Confront architecture models to specialty engineering tools
			(performance, safety, etc.)</li>
		<li>Iteratively populate downstream engineering (subsystems, code
			generation, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
