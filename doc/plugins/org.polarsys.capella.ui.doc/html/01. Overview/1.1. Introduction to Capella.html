  <h1 id="Introduction_to_Capella">Introduction to Capella</h1> 
  <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2> 
  <p>Capella is the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) solution provided by CST/EPM in Orchestra. It is a Tooled-Up-Process solution, enacting Sys-EM and Arcadia, supporting Systems Engineering and Software Architecture Engineering. The Capella primary objectives are to define a unified engineering language across Thales, to provide a seamless engineering workflow framework, to automate engineering tasks ensuring modelling productivity and quality, to manage information consistency, to capitalise and reuse engineering know-how and best practices and to ensure collaborative modelling work.</p> 
  <p>Thales Units and Areas, through the Deployment Committee and the Ochestra Key Projects, manage the Capella strategy and roadmap.</p> 
  <h2 id="System_and_Software_Architecture_Definition_in_a_Tool">System and Software Architecture Definition in a Tool</h2> 
  <p>Defining a system architecture means</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Performing and refining a <b>functional analysis</b> </li> 
   <li>Defining and <b>refining use cases</b> </li> 
   <li> <b>Defining components</b> realizing the functions of the system </li> 
   <li> <b>Defining the interfaces</b> between these components </li> 
   <li> <b>Model the dynamics of the system</b> with scenarios </li> 
   <li>Take into account <b>non-functional constraints</b> (Performance, Safety, Human Factors, etc.) </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2 id="A_Methodological_Guide_in_a_Tool">A Methodological Guide in a Tool</h2> 
  <p>In Thales, methodologies exist to help and guide the various actors of the engineering process. It is notably the case of</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <b>Sys-EM</b>, which defines the successive stages of the engineering process </li> 
   <li> <b>Arcadia</b>, which compliments Sys-EM with a brick specifically dedicated to the functional analysis and architecture definition. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> <b>Capella leverages these methodologies and embeds them in a tool, which is helping and guiding the system engineer in its activity</b>. </p> 
  <p>Is also provides Thales-wide language and tools, very close to (and interoperable with) industry standards such as UML and Sys-ML. This ensures a better understanding between Thales engineers from all domains.</p>
