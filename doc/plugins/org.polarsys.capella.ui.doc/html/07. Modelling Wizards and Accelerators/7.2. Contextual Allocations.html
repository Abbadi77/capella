  <h1 id="Contextual_Allocations">Contextual Allocations</h1> 
  <p>A specific dialog can be called contextually to one or several elements in order to manage their allocations to other elements.</p> 
  <p> <img height="90" width="333" border="0" src="Images/7.2.%20Contextual%20Allocations_html_3b72ac99.png" /> </p> 
  <p>Possible allocations:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <b>Operational Activities to Operational Entities / Actors</b> (allocation relationship) </li> 
   <li> <b>Functions to Actor / System / Components</b> (allocation relationship) </li> 
   <li> <b>Exchange Items to Interfaces</b> (reference relationship) </li> 
   <li> <b>Functional Exchanges to Component Exchanges</b> (allocation relationship) </li> 
   <li> <b>Physical Component Parts to Physical Component Parts</b> (deployment relationship) </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> <br /> <br /> </p> 
  <h2 id="Example:_Allocation_of_Activities_and_Functions_to_Entities.2C_Actors.2C_Components">Example: Allocation of Activities and Functions to Entities, Actors, Components</h2> 
  <p>Most of the time, allocating a Function to a Component is achieved through an architecture diagram or through the Component Editor.</p> 
  <p> <img height="466" width="825" border="0" src="Images/7.2.%20Contextual%20Allocations_html_m189f0de5.png" /> </p> 
  <p>The allocation can also be performed the other way round: by opening a contextual dialog on a Function or Activity, all possible Components proposed (according to the current engineering phase: Entities, Actors, System, Logical Components, Physical Components). This command is available both from the Project Explorer and the Diagrams.</p> 
  <p>One of the main advantage of this contextual allocation dialog is that is allows selecting several Functions / Activities at once and allocate them to the selected element.</p>

  <p>The possible choices are then proposed.</p>
