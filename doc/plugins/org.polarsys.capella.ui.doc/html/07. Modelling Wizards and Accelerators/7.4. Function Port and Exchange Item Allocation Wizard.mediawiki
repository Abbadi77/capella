==Principles==

 
Capella Function Port and EI Allocation tool provides means manage Function / Port / Exchange Item traceability and allocations between two engineering phases.

 
With this tool a user can perform Exchange item allocation from one or several functions located in the source engineering phase to other functions in the following engineering phase, by launching a dedicated wizard via the &ldquo;Function Port and EI Traceability Wizard&rdquo; command of the contextual menu (see the following figure).

==Source Engineering Phase (SEP)==

 
The left pane of the following wizard represent all elements to be refined / enriched between the source architecture (SEP) and the target Architecture (TEP).

In the above figure, the Function &ldquo;LogicalFunction 1&rdquo; has one Port &ldquo;FOP1&rdquo; which exposes the Exchange Item &ldquo;ExchangeItem1&rdquo;.

 
<br>
<br>

 
==Target Engineering Phase (TEP)==

 
The right pane contains all the TEP elements contributing to the realization of the SEP elements.

In the above figure, the Function &ldquo;PhysicalFunction 1&rdquo; gets a new Exchange Item provided by &ldquo;LogicalFunction 1&rdquo;.

==Features==

 
* All displayed SEP Functions without one 	traceability link coming from the TEP is shown to user with RED 	color.
* All displayed SEP Ports without one 	traceability link coming from the TEP is shown to user with RED 	color.
* When an Exchange Item allocated to one Port FP located in the SEP is 	not allocated to at least one of the port realization in the TEP, 	the Exchange Item line will be displayed with red color in the left 	pane.
* When a Function or Function Port is selected 	in the left pane, the tracing elements in the right pane are 	highlighted.
* A user can drag and drop all displayed Exchange Items from left to 	right or from right to left pane.
* When performing drag and drop of Exchange Item allocations from a 	SEP Port to a TEP Port, a traceability link between the two Ports is 	created automatically if it does not exist yet
* All elements displayed in the wizard can be shown in Capella Explorer 	or Semantic Browser by using a contextual menu &ldquo; Show in 	Capella Explorer&rdquo;
 
==Creation of Elements in the TEP (Right pane of the wizard)==

 
* '''Elements creation or modification'''
  
* '''Creation of Traceability link'''
