  <p>On an existing dataflow diagram, select all the Functional Exchanges contributing to your Functional Chain.</p>

  <p>Using the contextual menu on this multiple selection, click on Functional Chain / Create a Functional Chain</p> 
  <p>A new Functional Chain is created and displayed.</p>

  <p>If you want to edit a Functional Chain, you have to create a Functional Chain Description diagram. You can create this diagram from a Navigate command in the contextual menu from a Functional Chain.</p> 
  <p>A new diagram is created, representing your Functional Chain. What you see on this diagram are not Functions and Exchanges but Functional Chain Involvement elements. This is a essentially a &quot;working&quot; diagram.</p>

  <p>On the following diagram, the tools of the palette have been used to include a new Function and new Exchanges so that we have a branch.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The “Involve Function” tool simply adds a new element representing a Function. It is the responsibility of the user to add the necessary Functional Exchanges in order to form a complete Functional Chain.</li> 
   <li>The “Involve Functional Exchange” allows selecting a possible (already existing) Exchange between the selected source and target elements representing Functions.</li> 
   <li>The “Involve Functional Chain” tool adds a new element representing a Functional Chain. It is the responsibility of the user to add the necessary Functional Exchanges in order to form a complete Functional Chain.</li> 
   <li>The “Involve Functional Exchange and Target Function” is contextual to the selected source Function element: it allows creating at the same time both the elements representing an outgoing Exchange and the Target Function.</li>

  <p>On the dataflow diagram, the result is the following.</p>
