= Physical Component Editor =

This wizard helps you setting the properties of a Physical Component.

== Base ==

|-
| '''Field'''
| '''Description'''
| '''Default'''
|-
| '''Name'''
| The name of the current Element.
| &lt;generic name&gt;
|-
| '''Summary'''
| A short headline about the role of the current Element.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Implemented Interfaces'''
| The list of Interfaces directly implemented (i.e. not through Component Ports) by the current Component.  Interfaces aggregate Exchange items (Operations, Events, Flows, Shared Data).
''Note: Unless having a good reason to do so, Implemented Interfaces shall not be used when strictly following the Arcadia methodology.''
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Used Interfaces'''
| The list of Interfaces directly used (i.e. not through Component Ports) by the current Component.  Interfaces aggregate Exchange items (Operations, Events, Flows, Shared Data).
''Note: Unless having a good reason to do so, Implemented Interfaces shall not be used when strictly following the Arcadia methodology.''
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Allocated Functions'''
| The list of Physical Functions performed by the current Component.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Realized Logical Components'''
| One or several Logical Components the current Physical Component is refining.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Physical Component Kind'''
| The kind of the Physical Component. The purpose of this feature is to bring additional information on the Physical Component. It is optional and has no impact on the tooling.
| UNSET
|-
| '''Physical Component Nature'''
| The nature of the Physical Component (BEHAVIOR or NODE).
· A Behavioral component is a Physical Component in charge of implementing / realizing part of the functions allocated to the System (software component, VHDL program, etc.) <br>
· A Node component is a material Physical Component embedding one or several Behavioral Components.<br>

Selecting the nature of the Physical Component is essential, as the tooling is different for each of them.

== Description==

This field contains the business description of the current element. Links towards other model elements or diagrams can be created in this description using the &quot;Add Link&quot; button.

By default this field in read-only, so that hyperlinks can be navigated. To start editing the description, click first on the &quot;Edit&quot; button at the very left side of the toolbar.

== Extensions ==                  

{| border="1"
|-
| '''Field'''
| '''Description'''
| '''Default'''
|-
| '''Applied Property Values'''
| One or several Property Values related to the current Element. These Property Values might be located right under the current Element or anywhere else in the Model.
The "browse" button allows associating an already existing Property Value (not necessarily located under the current Element). The "cross" button allows removing the association between the selected Property Value and the current Element. This action does not delete the Property Value itself.
| &lt;blank&gt;
|-
| '''Applied Property Value Group'''
| One or several Property Value Groups related to the current Element. These Property Values Group and the Property Values they contain might be located right under the current Element or anywhere else in the Model.
The "browse" button allows associating an already existing Property Group (not necessarily located under the current Element). The "cross" button allows removing the association between the selected Property Value and the current Element. This action does not delete the Property Value itself.

== Management ==                       

{| border="1"
|-
| '''Field'''
| '''Description'''
| '''Default'''
|-
| '''Visible in Documentation'''
| Specifies whether this element is exposed to the Documentation Generation tool.
| True
|-
| '''Progress Status'''
| Not all elements in the design phase of a System have the same maturity (some are Drafts, some need to be reviewed, etc.). This field allows setting the maturity level of the current Element.
