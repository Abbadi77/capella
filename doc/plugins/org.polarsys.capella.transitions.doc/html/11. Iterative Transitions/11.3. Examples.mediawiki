=== Overview ===
 
Let's consider the following analysis at Operational Analysis:

It can be described in a Operational Activity Interaction Blank:

=== Performing the First Transition ===
 
Let&rsquo;s perform the first transition (the System Analysis is considered empty, except default model elements)

== Advanced (Linked Elements i.e. Out of Containment) ==
 
=== Overview ===
 
Let&rsquo;s consider the following situation:

 
[[Image:Images/11.3.%20Examples_html_6ac74814.png|634x341px]]

 
The '''High command''' is '''realized by System''' and the '''Soldier''' is a '''System Actor''' (see the contextual menu:

 
[[Image:Images/11.3.%20Examples_html_m29c1a900.png|497x48px]]

 
).

 
=== Performing the First Transition ===
 
The focus is on the transition to Operational Activity allocations to System Function allocations.

 
The Operational Activities to System Functions are automatically performs during the Realized by System and System Actor transitions.

Renaming, deletion, move are not propagated during update.
