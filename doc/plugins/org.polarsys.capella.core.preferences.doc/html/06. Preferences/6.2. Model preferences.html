		The &ldquo;Check model version at load time&rdquo; provides a security
		when opening a model. It checks whether the model has been produced
		with the current version and thus <b>whether it needs to be
			migrated or not</b>. <b>The drawback of activating this check is that
			the opening of models takes twice as long</b>.

	<p>The AIRD Fragment File Extension option allows specifying the

	<h2 id="DELETE">DELETE</h2>
	<p>On the sub section of Capella / Delete preferences, it is
		possible to specify deletion options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If &ldquo;<b>Confirm deletions</b>&rdquo; is activated, then
			a confirmation dialog will be prompted for each deletion attempt.
			This dialog show a live impact analysis of the deletion.
		</li>
		<li>If &ldquo;<b>If reusing components is allowed,
				synchronize &hellip;</b>&rdquo; is activated, then when deleting a
			Component, all the Parts that are typed by this component will be
			deleted as well.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Protected Elements</b>: It is possible to prohibit the deletion of
		certain critical elements. In that case, the deletion command will not
		be active for these elements.

		When &ldquo;<b>Multiple inheritance allowed</b>&rdquo; is activated, a
		Class can inherit from several other Classes. Otherwise, it can only
		have one inheritance ancestor.
	</p>
	<p>
		When &ldquo;<b>Multiple deployment allowed</b>&rdquo; is activated,
		one given Behaviour Physical Component can be deployed on several Node
		Physical Components.
	</p>
	<p>
		When &ldquo;<b>Delete related associations when a class becomes
			primitive</b>&rdquo; is activated, existing associations towards the
		class which primitive status has changed is deleted automatically. If
		this option is not activated, then model validation is such cases will
		raise an error and the end user will be able to manually delete the
		obsolete association.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>The three synchronization options define whether Port
			allocations and delegations are automatically set</b> when performing

	<p>The sub sections of the Overview Preferences allow specifying

		When the &ldquo;<b>Project</b>&rdquo; option is activated, the

		below). By default, this option is not active. Displaying the
		&ldquo;Project&rdquo; model element is useful
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If there is a need to manage several system models in the
			same Capellamodeller resource (not really common),</li>
		<li>In order to modify configuration property values located on
			the Project element (reusable components or not, default values for
			progress monitoring, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>By default, this option should be deactivated.</p>

		The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Allow diagram creation</b>&rdquo; specifies
		whether a diagram shall be automatically created for the target
		scenario of the refinement.
	</p>
	<p>
		The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Allow diagram opening</b>&rdquo; specifies
		whether the diagram corresponding to the target scenario of the
		refinement shall be automatically opened or not.
	</p>
	<p>
		The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Perform a pre-validation</b>&rdquo; specifies
		whether the refinement tool shall perform a set of elementary check
		verifying the source scenario are ready for refinement. It is strongly
		recommended to activate this option as well as the following one
		&ldquo;<b>Stop Refinement on pre-validation error</b>&rdquo;.

	<ul>
		<li>The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Use STANDARD Component Port rather
				than FLOW Component Port</b>&rdquo; specifies whether generation of
			component exchanges and interfaces generate STANDARD Component Port
			rather than FLOW Component Port.
		</li>
		<li>The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Generate Component Port while
				generating Interfaces</b>&rdquo; specifies whether generation of
			interfaces from allocated functions generates providing/requiring
			Component Port rather than implementation/usage links.
		</li>
		<li>The radio buttons &ldquo;<b>Propagate logical component
				breakdown in physical architecture</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>Propagate
				only leaf logical components in physical architecture</b>&rdquo;
			specifies whether the breakdown of Logical Components is kept at
			physical level or not.
		</li>
		<li>The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Transit interfaces handled by
				Components from context/logical layers to physical architecture</b>&rdquo;
			specifies whether interfaces are duplicated from Logical architecture
			to Physical architecture when performing a Logical Component to
			Physical Component transition. If not activated, Physical Components
			will directly implement / use / provide / require interface located
			in the system analysis and logical architecture.
		</li>
		<li>The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Transit allocated Exchange Items
				while transition of Interfaces, Functions or Components</b>&rdquo;
			specifies whether Interfaces, Functions or Components transition
			triggers transition of related Exchange Items (i.e. duplicates
			Exchange Items from one engineering phase to the following one). If
			not activated, Interface, Functions and Component Exchanges in the
			target engineering phase will still refer the Exchange Items located
			in the previous engineering phase.
		</li>
		<li>The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Transit Data Types handled by
				Exchange Items while transition of Exchange Items</b>&rdquo; specifies
			whether Exchange Items transition triggers transition of related Data
			(i.e. duplicates Data from one engineering phase to the following
			one). If not activated, Exchange Items in the target engineering
			phase will still refer the Data elements located in the previous
			engineering phase.
		</li>
		<li>The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Transit State Machines owned by a
				Component while transition of Components</b>&rdquo; specifies whether
			State Machines transition is triggered when performing a Component
			transition.
		</li>
		<li>The checkbox &ldquo;<b>Transit Functional elements
				allocated by an Operational Entity or Operational Actor while their
				transition</b>&rdquo; specifies whether Operational Activities are
			transformed into System Functions when performing a transition of
			Operational Entities or Actors.
		</li>
		<li>The checkbox <b>&ldquo;Include involved elements&rdquo;</b>
			on the Property Values section specifies whether involved elements
			will be propagated while a transition of Property Values
		</li>
