	<p>
		By default, &ldquo;<b>Automatic Refresh</b>&rdquo; is set to true (see
		the Eclipse Window / Preferences / Viewpoint page): this means
		diagrams always display the latest state of the model. There are at
		least two cases where it is recommended to rely on manual rather than
		automatic refresh:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When diagrams size grows, it might be necessary to disable
			automatic refresh in order to improve performance. In that case, new
			calculated elements can be displayed on a diagram by performing a
			manual refresh through the specific toolbar Refresh button or by
			reopening the diagram.</li>
		<li>When several users collaborate on the same model using
			Clearcase or SVN.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		&ldquo;<b>Do refresh on representation opening</b>&rdquo; specifies
		whether a refresh is systematically performed when opening a diagram.
		Unless working in a collaborative environment with Clearcase or SVN,
		this option should be set to True.
	</p>
	<p>
		The option &ldquo;<b>Always create a aird fragment on control</b>&rdquo;
		should always be activated. It allows keeping the model and
		representation files fragmented accordingly. <i>The two other
			options in this page are irrelevant in the context of Capella.</i>
