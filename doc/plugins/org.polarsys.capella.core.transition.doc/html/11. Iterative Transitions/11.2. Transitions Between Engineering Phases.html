	<h2 id="OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</h2>
	<p>An automated transition should not always include all modeling
		elements from a phase to a lower phase. To offer flexibility to the
		user and to allow performing transition of specific parts from a phase
		into a lower phase, modeling concepts have been categorized into
		activities, which are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Data transition</li>
		<li>Exchange Item transition</li>
		<li>State machine transition</li>
		<li>Interface transition</li>
		<li>Operation Activity transition</li>
		<li>Operational Entity transition</li>
		<li>Functional transition</li>
		<li>Actor transition</li>
		<li>Logical to Physical Component transition</li>
		<li>Port transition</li>
	</ul>
	<p>An activity is (of course) linked to others activities but
		categorizing modelling elements into these activities defines entry
		points for the user to trigger the automated transition.</p>
	<h2 id="TRANSITION_ENTRY_POINTS">TRANSITION ENTRY POINTS</h2>
	<p>This section provides a simplified version of transition graph
		for each entry points to trigger transition and determines scope of
		transition for these entry points.</p>
