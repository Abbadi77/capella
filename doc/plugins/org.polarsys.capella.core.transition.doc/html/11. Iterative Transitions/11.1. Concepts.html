		CONCEPTS</h1>
	<h2 id="OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</h2>
	<p>The Capella Iterative Transition is a model transformation
		within a Capella Model. It aims to transform concepts into other
		concepts. For instance, transforming Operational Activities into
		Functions.</p>
	<p>Most of Iterative Model Transformation engines are destructive.
		The Capella Model Transformation engine is conservative. It means that
		it is not one shot, it is possible to rerun the transformation after
		changes in the source and/or target models. It requires traceability
		links between transformed elements.</p>
	<h2 id="WHAT_IS_DONE_DURING_AN_ITERATIVE_TRANSFORMATION_.3F">WHAT
		IS DONE DURING AN ITERATIVE TRANSFORMATION ?</h2>
	<p>An Iterative Transition considers the following rules:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If there is a source element but not traced to a target
			element, the target element is created.</li>
		<li>If the source element is moved (no more linked to the
			transformed related element), the target element is moved too.</li>
		<li>If the source element is deleted, the target element is kept.</li>
		<li>If the target element is moved, the target element is moved
			to its original location.</li>
		<li>If the target element is deleted, the transformation process
			will create the target element again.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="THE_TRANFORMATION_ENGINE">THE TRANFORMATION ENGINE</h3>
	<p>The transformation engine takes 2 models as input: a source
		model and a target model.</p>
	<p>The engine is rule-based, i.e. it is implemented with
		transformation rules.</p>
	<p>The engine builds an agenda of transformed elements based on
		model element dependencies. The rules detect the relevant dependencies
		for the transformation.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="243" width="730" border="0"
			src="Images/11.1.%20Concepts_html_65bc7c12.png" />
	</p>
	<p>After the agenda building, the agenda is parsed and rules are
		applied. The result is a set of transformed elements.</p>
	<p>During a second parse, these elements are attached and linked to
		existing elements in the target model part. No element is destroyed
		(it is conservative).</p>
	<h3 id="AUTOMATED_CHANGES_DETECTION">AUTOMATED CHANGES DETECTION</h3>
	<p>
		There is a way to perform changes detection in most cases when
		performing a 1-to-1-concept mapping: <b>&quot;The linked
			transformed element shall be the transformed linked element.&quot;</b>
	</p>
	<p>This rule is applicable for containment and other relationships.
		But the containment is considered as mandatory in most cases, that is
		why it is named the 'Clone/Ownership Clone' process.</p>
	<p>A and B are in the source model. A' and B' are in the target
		model.</p>
