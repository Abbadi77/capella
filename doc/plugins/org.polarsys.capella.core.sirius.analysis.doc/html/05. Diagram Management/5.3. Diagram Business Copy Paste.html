	<h1 id="THE_DIAGRAM_BUSINESS_COPY-PASTE">THE DIAGRAM BUSINESS
		COPY-PASTE</h1>
	<p>Elements in a diagram can be copied and pasted via the usual
		CTRL-C and CTRL-V shortcuts, or via the contextual menu which pops up
		at right click.</p>
	<p>This copy/paste mechanism duplicates both the selected elements
		in the underlying model and their graphical representations. Business
		rules ensure that the model remains consistent after a paste
		operation. The business rules both depend on which diagram is being
		edited and which elements are selected.</p>
	<p>Note that a quick paste feature (CTRL-SHIFT-V) is also
		available. It does not automatically refresh the diagram, which
		prevents edges from being drawn but saves time. It can be handy to
		paste elements multiple times and rearrange them by hand before
		refreshing the diagram (e.g. via the Refresh button in the toolbar).</p>
	<h2 id="EXAMPLE_OF_LOGICAL_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM">EXAMPLE OF
		LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM</h2>
	<p>To understand how the copy/paste mechanism works, let us
		consider the Logical Architecture Blank diagram as an example. In the
		figure below, the two subcomponents Sensor and Filter are selected.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="192" width="446" border="0"
			src="Images/5.3.%20Diagram%20Business%20Copy%20Paste_html_20311ae1.png" />
	</p>
	<p>Let us execute the following steps: press CTRL-C, click the
		diagram background, move the mouse cursor below component Sensor Unit,
		then press CTRL-V. We obtain the following diagram.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="273" width="401" border="0"
			src="Images/5.3.%20Diagram%20Business%20Copy%20Paste_html_m51ff35d9.png" />
	</p>
	<p>
		The selected subcomponents have been duplicated at the position of the
		mouse cursor (top-left corner). They have also been renamed.
		Components contain their input ports, so those have been duplicated.
		Note, however, that the functions have not been duplicated. This is
		because the sub components do not <i>contain</i> the functions, but
		the functions are just <i>allocated</i> to them. The allocations
		themselves could have been duplicated, so that Data reception would
		have been allocated to both Sensor and Sensor_1, but that would have
		been against the Capella Component to Functions allocation rules.
	</p>
	<p>We may want to duplicate the allocated functions and
		corresponding exchanges as well. For that purpose, let us select the
		components as before, plus a subset of the functions and exchanges, as
		in the figure below.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="200" width="477" border="0"
			src="Images/5.3.%20Diagram%20Business%20Copy%20Paste_html_m4a16833b.png" />
	</p>
	<p>Let us execute the copy/paste steps as before: we then obtain
		the following diagram.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="320" width="476" border="0"
			src="Images/5.3.%20Diagram%20Business%20Copy%20Paste_html_33db2eed.png" />
	</p>
	<p>All selected functions have been duplicated, which is why Init
		is not present. The selected exchanges whose source and target have
		been duplicated are connected to the copies. When the source only or
		the target only is duplicated, the other end is connected to the
		original function, which is why filtered data_1 is connected to
		Interpretation.</p>
	<h2 id="EXAMPLE:_COMPONENT_EXTERNAL_INTERFACES_DIAGRAM">EXAMPLE:
		COMPONENT EXTERNAL INTERFACES DIAGRAM</h2>
	<p>We have seen that whenever components are copy/pasted, their
		function allocations are not duplicated if the functions are not
		duplicated. This rule is specific to function allocations and Logical
		Architecture Blank diagrams. The behaviour can be different for other
		kinds of elements and diagrams.</p>
	<p>Let us consider a Component Internal Interfaces diagram. In the
		figure below, the select component is being copy/pasted.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="162" width="279" border="0"
			src="Images/5.3.%20Diagram%20Business%20Copy%20Paste_html_m597582b4.png" />
	</p>
	<p>The resulting diagram is as follows.</p>
	<p>
		<img height="197" width="332" border="0"
			src="Images/5.3.%20Diagram%20Business%20Copy%20Paste_html_m5e9522c.png" />
	</p>
	<p>We can notice that the Interface Use / Require and Interface
		Implementation / Provide relations have been duplicated and are linked
		to the original interfaces. This is again a specific business rule
		which aims at obtaining the expected result in one step.</p>
