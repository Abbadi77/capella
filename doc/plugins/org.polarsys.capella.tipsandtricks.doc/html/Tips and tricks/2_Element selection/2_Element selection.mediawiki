==Automatic cursor selection of diagram elements==

When a diagram is composed of a lot of elements (components, functions, edges...) it can become fastidious to select some of them to apply them a specific styling or other.

Thats why, two selection modes are realizable thanks to your computer cursor:



# '''''From the left to the right: '''''it selects automatically all the elements contained in your selection area (Figure 1);
# '''''From the right to the left: '''''it selects not only automatically all the elements contained in your selection area but also those which cross it (Figure 2);

==Connectors selection==



It can be necessary to '''select all connectors''' to change the routing style or remove bend point for example and select them one by one can quickly become a fastidious task. 

Thus, you can select all diagram connectors in the same time by selecting '''''Select All Connectors''''' on the diagram menu.
