==Automatic Cursor Selection Of Diagram Elements==

When a diagram displays a lot of elements (components, functions, edges...) it can be fastidious to select some of them to apply a specific styling or other.

That's why, two selection modes are available with the mouse cursor:

# '''''From the left to the right: '''''to select the elements contained in the selection area (Figure 1). (for example if you want to select all ports of a component on the same side without selecting the exchanges or the component itself.)
# '''''From the right to the left: '''''to select the elements contained in the selection area '''''AND''''' also those which cross it (Figure 2). (for example if you want to select exchanges without their ports.)

==Connectors Selection==

Connectors can be selected one by one. As it can be fastidious to select all the connectors of a diagram one by one, to change the routing style or remove bend point for example, use the button '''''Select All Connectors''''' on the diagram menu instead.
