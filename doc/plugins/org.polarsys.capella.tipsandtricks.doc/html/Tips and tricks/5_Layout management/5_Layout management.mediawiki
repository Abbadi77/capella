==Diagram Template==

==Layout mode ==

Once all your elements are placed on your diagram, you can activate the Layout Mode in order to displace them but their allocation on other elements could not be modified.

==Layout/Style Capella Copy/Paste==

You can Copy/Paste the layout and the style of elements to reuse them in another diagram containing the same elements:
