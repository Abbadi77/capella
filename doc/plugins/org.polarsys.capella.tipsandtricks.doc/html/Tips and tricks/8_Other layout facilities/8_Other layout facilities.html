		<p>In order to 
			<b>facilitate the layout set up of elements on diagrams</b>, some functionalities exist:  
		</p>
		<h2 id="Elements_Alignement">Elements Alignement</h2>
		<p>If you select several elements, you can align them on the right, middle, left, top...</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../Images/Tips20.png"/>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Elements_Distribution">Elements Distribution</h2>
		<p>If you select several elements, you can distribute them vertically, horizontally (i.e ensure that there is a gap of the same size between each element in the chosen direction).</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<h2 id="Layout_commands_to_set_edges_with_connected_ports_vertical_or_horizontal">Layout commands to set edges with connected ports vertical or horizontal</h2>
		<p>The goal of this feature is to 
			<b>assist user to set edge selection vertical or horizontal</b> in order to help exchange layout. If the edge is connected to "ports", the 
			<b>"port" is moved too</b>.''
			To do this, it is recommended to arrange all connected ports first, then use the right-to-left multiple selection.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<h2 id="Arrange_connected_ports">Arrange connected ports</h2>
		<p>In addition to the standard automatic layout, this specific action allows 
			<b>to arrange automatically the edges/ports so that they are as short as possible by preserving routing style</b>. This action moves the ports of a node / container when necessary. It is useful when the positions of the nodes and containers have already been defined and edges still need a better layout.

		<h2 id="Multi_selection_for_graphical_move_of_ports.2Bexchanges">Multi selection for graphical move of ports+exchanges</h2>
		<p>This feature aims to 
			<b>move the group {edge, labels, ports}</b> in a single operation when using the 
			<b>
				<i>F3 shortcut</i>
			</b> and drag/move the edge.
		</p>
		<p>Moreover, by selecting multiple edges with ports and pressing 
			<b>
				<i>F3</i>
			</b> key, you can move them simultaneously:
