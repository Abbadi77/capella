==Print Area Preview==

Before sending a diagram to a printer, it can be interesting to arrange the elements of the diagram to avoid them to be split by a page break, to help doing so use the command '''''Diagram > View > page Breaks''''' to display page breaks on the diagram background.

Note: Use the same command to hide the page breaks displayed on the diagram.
