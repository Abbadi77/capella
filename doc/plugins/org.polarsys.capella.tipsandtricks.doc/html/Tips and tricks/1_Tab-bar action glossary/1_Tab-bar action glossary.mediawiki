=Tab-Bar Actions Glossary=

The top area of all Sirius diagram editors is filled with the '''tab-bar''', which provides access to '''many operations on diagrams and their elements '''such as "automatic layout tool, selection tool, Show/Hide tool..." The content of the tab-bar will depend on whether the current selection is the diagram itself (i.e. no element is selected) or one or several diagram elements.
