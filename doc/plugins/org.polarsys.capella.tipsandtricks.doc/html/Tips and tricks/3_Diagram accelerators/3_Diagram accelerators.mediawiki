== CONTEXTUAL to a model element ==

Contextual diagrams are used to put the focus on one specific element. This makes them have specific refresh rules. For more details, please refer to the section Capella Guide > User Manual > Diagram Management > Diagram Concepts > Blank and Contextual Diagrams, Contextual Diagram Elements

==Diagram accelerators==
From a diagram, Capella provides a few tools called accelerators allowing automated synchronization or generations of model elements. For more details, please refer to the section Capella Guide > User Manual > Modelling Wizards and Accelerators

The idea is to initialize and then apply layout from diagram template for instance. In order to save time, Capella is able to initialize diagrams from others, not only in a same layer but also between different layers. 

* For example, in the ''System Analysis'', from a ''Function Scenario'', you can initialize an ''Exchange Scenario'' thanks to the '''''Transition''''' functionality:

* Another example from the ''System Analysis'' to the ''Logical Architecture'' is that you can also initialize an ''Exchange Scenario'' thanks to the '''''Transition''''' functionality:
