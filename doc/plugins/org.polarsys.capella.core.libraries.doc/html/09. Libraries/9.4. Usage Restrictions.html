	<h2 id="Librairies_usage_restriction">Librairies usage restriction</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Trying to open a model (library or project) while one of its
			referenced libraries is not present in the workspace is not possible.<br />
			If you want to use a project without referenced libraries you can use
			the <i>Detach tool</i> to remove references of missing libraries
		</li>
		<li>Downgraded use cases are not properly supported. Please be
			aware of the constraints described in the following section.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<br />
	</p>
	<h2 id="NOMINAL_CASE_VS_DOWNGRADED_CASES">NOMINAL CASE VS
		DOWNGRADED CASES</h2>
	<p>Violation of one of these rules might shift the user into
		downgraded use cases:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Replace a library by another version while a referencing
			project is opened (for instance through an update from Clearcase)</li>
		<li>Perform action that creates a reference between two objects
			from different models M1, M2 (project or library) where M2 is
			referencing M1. For instance, if a project is referencing a library,
			create a generalization from a class in the library to a class in the
			project. Such a situation can be obtained when moving graphically
			elements between diagrams. Future version of Capella will provide an
			automatic check to prevent such a situation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<br />
	</p>
	<h2 id="USE_Cases_Changes">USE Cases Changes</h2>
	<p>In Capella, working sessions on models are fully separated,
		meaning that modifications made on a library will not appear on the
		project until session library is saved.</p>
