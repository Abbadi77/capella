Create a library
 
[[Image:Images/9.3.%20Usage%20With%20Replicable%20Elements_html_mf56c06f.png|446x196px]]
 
In the Logical Architecture, create some elements and create a REC from them.

[[Image:Images/9.3.%20Usage%20With%20Replicable%20Elements_html_7bfa792f.png|627x266px]]
 
The dialog display the content of the REC

After creation, the REC is available In the library.

Ensure your library is saved.

In a Logical Architecture Blank diagram, instantiate a new RPL
 
[[Image:Images/9.3.%20Usage%20With%20Replicable%20Elements_html_m5ac174b.png|627x83px]]
 
<br>
 
In the dialog, select the REC located in the referenced library:

Display all elements of the RPL in the diagram
 
[[Image:Images/9.3.%20Usage%20With%20Replicable%20Elements_html_4c273205.png|443x139px]]
 
FE1 from the RPL is linked to Exchange Items located in the library.
