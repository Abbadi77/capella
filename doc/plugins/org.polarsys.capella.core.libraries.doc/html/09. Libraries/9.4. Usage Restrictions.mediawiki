= USAGE RESTRICTIONS =
 
== Librairies usage restriction ==
 
* Trying to open a model (library or project) while one of its referenced libraries is not present in the workspace is not possible.<br> If you want to use a project without referenced libraries you can use the ''Detach tool'' to remove references of missing libraries
* Downgraded use cases are not properly supported. Please be aware of the constraints described in the following section.
 
<br>
 
== NOMINAL CASE VS DOWNGRADED CASES ==
 
Violation of one of these rules might shift the user into downgraded use cases:
 
* Replace a library by another version while a referencing project is opened (for instance through an update from Clearcase)
* Perform action that creates a reference between two objects from different models M1, M2 (project or library) where M2 is referencing M1. For instance, if a project is referencing a library, create a generalization from a class in the library to a class in the project. Such a situation can be obtained when moving graphically elements between diagrams. Future version of Capella will provide an automatic check to prevent such a situation.
 
<br>
 
== USE Cases Changes ==
 
In Capella, working sessions on models are fully separated, meaning that modifications made on a library will not appear on the project until session library is saved.

(note the (*) on the '''library''' when the element has been renamed. It doesn&rsquo;t appear on ''Project_1'' before the session of ''A_Library'' is saved)
