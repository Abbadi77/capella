== CONCEPTS ==
 
A Library is a Capella model intended to be shared between several Projects.
 
[[Image:Images/9.1.%20Introduction_html_65396e1a.png|533x246px]]
 
A Project can reference a Library with READ or READ/WRITE mode. In the latter case, this means the Library content can be modified from the Project itself, without having to specifically open the Library.
 
A library can have references towards other Libraries, but a Library cannot have a reference towards a Project.
 
What are Libraries intended for?
 
* Allow reuse of model elements across different models (for example, several Projects in one domain often need to share the same data model).
* Enhance organization (avoid duplication and references between models)
* Host catalogs of Replicable Elements
 
Libraries benefit of same tooling than models.
 
* Edition of library&rsquo;s content via diagrams and editors
* Semantic browser
* Validation rules &amp; quick fixes[[Image:Images/9.1.%20Introduction_html_m2f4cc7f5.jpg|92x92px]][[Image:Images/9.1.%20Introduction_html_733c5d5d.jpg|92x92px]]
