The Mass Editing Capella Integration allows users to change multiple model elements simultaneously. These elements are selected from a table and have all of their changeable features in common, such as Name, ID or Description.

By aggregating all the values of each of these features, users can quickly choose to either keep or overwrite them.

As to the Mass Visualization Capella Integration, it enables users to visualize the common features of numerous model elements.

By grouping the objects according to their attributes, properties and relationships with other existing objects and filtering the result according to their custom patterns, users have a comprehensive overview over the target of their analysis.

In addition to all of the displayed information in the Mass Editing view, the Mass Visualization also displates non editable features and predefined queries (Semantic Browser queries for the moment).
