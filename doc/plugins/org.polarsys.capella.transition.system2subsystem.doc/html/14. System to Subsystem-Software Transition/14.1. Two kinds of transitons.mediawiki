= TWO KINDS OF TRANSITIONS =
 
'''System to Sub System transitions are top-down and iterative:''' any change performed in the original System can be propagated at any moment to the Sub System.
 
Traceability between System and Sub System is ensured through a '''mechanism based on system-wide ID&rsquo;s'''.
 
== VERTICAL TRANSITION WITH TRANSFORMATION ==
 
'''The objective of this transition is to re-apply the methodology starting from one or several given Configuration Item(s)'''. The transformation algorithm performs the following steps:
 
# Computation of the transitive closure of elements to be transformed or copied starting from one or several Configuration Items
# Transformation of elements (for example, a sibling ''Physical Component'' will become a ''System Actor'')
# Comparison with previous transition
# Merge

== SCOPED HORIZONTAL EXTRACTION ==
 
'''The objective of this transition is to extract a subset of the Physical or Logical Architecture and populate a new model with this subset'''. The transformation algorithm performs the following steps:
 
# Computation of the transitive closure of elements to be extracted starting from one or several Physical / Logical Components
# Comparison with previous extraction
# Merge
