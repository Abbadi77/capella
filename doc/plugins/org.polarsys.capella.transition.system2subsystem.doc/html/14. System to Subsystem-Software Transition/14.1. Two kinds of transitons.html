	<h1 id="TWO_KINDS_OF_TRANSITIONS">TWO KINDS OF TRANSITIONS</h1>
	<p>
		<b>System to Sub System transitions are top-down and iterative:</b>
		any change performed in the original System can be propagated at any
		moment to the Sub System.
	</p>
	<p>
		Traceability between System and Sub System is ensured through a <b>mechanism
			based on system-wide ID&rsquo;s</b>.

		TRANSITION WITH TRANSFORMATION</h2>
	<p>
		<b>The objective of this transition is to re-apply the methodology
			starting from one or several given Configuration Item(s)</b>. The
		transformation algorithm performs the following steps:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Computation of the transitive closure of elements to be
			transformed or copied starting from one or several Configuration
			Items</li>
		<li>Transformation of elements (for example, a sibling <i>Physical
				Component</i> will become a <i>System Actor</i>)
		</li>
		<li>Comparison with previous transition</li>
		<li>Merge</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		<b>The objective of this transition is to extract a subset of the
			Physical or Logical Architecture and populate a new model with this
			subset</b>. The transformation algorithm performs the following steps:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Computation of the transitive closure of elements to be
			extracted starting from one or several Physical / Logical Components</li>
		<li>Comparison with previous extraction</li>
		<li>Merge</li>
