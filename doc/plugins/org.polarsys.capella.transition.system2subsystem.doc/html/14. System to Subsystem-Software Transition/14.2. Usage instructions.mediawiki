=== Gap analysis with previous iteration of the transition ===
 
Once the target project selected, a dialog displaying the differences and the actions planned by the transition is displayed.
 
In the window, elements are sorted out by types
 
* The column &quot;Type&quot; indicates whether the difference concerns the presence of an element &ldquo;Element&rdquo; or the modification of a reference on an element &quot;Reference&quot;.
* The column &quot;Scope&quot; indicates whether the difference was found on the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; or &ldquo;Target&rdquo; model
* The column &quot;Differences&quot; indicates the title of the difference.
* The column &quot;Action&quot; indicates the type of action planned by the transition:
** &quot;Merge into target&quot;: application of the merge of the difference in the output model
** &quot;No predefined Action&quot;: the difference is not taken into account
*
* The column &quot;Detail&quot; gives the complete detail of the difference to investigative purposes very thin.

The effective application of the transition is performed by clicking on the button &quot;Apply Transition &quot;. The &quot;Save has CSV&quot; button allows to export the differences in a CSV file for a further analysis of the deviations.
 
It is possible to choose the type of elements that should be displayed in the difference window. To do so, choose Window / Preferences and then Capella / Transition Log Preferences.
