	<p>Once the target project selected, a dialog displaying the
		differences and the actions planned by the transition is displayed.</p>
	<p>In the window, elements are sorted out by types</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The column &quot;Type&quot; indicates whether the difference
			concerns the presence of an element &ldquo;Element&rdquo; or the
			modification of a reference on an element &quot;Reference&quot;.</li>
		<li>The column &quot;Scope&quot; indicates whether the difference
			was found on the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; or &ldquo;Target&rdquo; model</li>
		<li>The column &quot;Differences&quot; indicates the title of the
			difference.</li>
		<li>The column &quot;Action&quot; indicates the type of action
			planned by the transition:
			<ul>
				<li>&quot;Merge into target&quot;: application of the merge of
					the difference in the output model</li>
				<li>&quot;No predefined Action&quot;: the difference is not
					taken into account</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>*</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The column &quot;Detail&quot; gives the complete detail of
			the difference to investigative purposes very thin.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The effective application of the transition is performed by
		clicking on the button &quot;Apply Transition &quot;. The &quot;Save
		has CSV&quot; button allows to export the differences in a CSV file
		for a further analysis of the deviations.</p>
	<p>It is possible to choose the type of elements that should be
		displayed in the difference window. To do so, choose Window /
		Preferences and then Capella / Transition Log Preferences.</p>
