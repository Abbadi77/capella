abstractFragmentationTest_EObjectNotSetted = The target EObject has not been set (yet?)
abstractFragmentationTest_UnsupportedKindOfdRepresentation = The DRepresentation ''{0}'' is not a DSemanticDecorator one. Please modify the test.
abstractFragmentationTest_wrongAirdresourceAfterOps = The DRepresentation ''{0}'' has not been moved at all or to the good AIRD resource.

abstractFragmentTest_DefaultDescription = Perform a fragmentation on a given object.

abstractFragmentTest_hasNotSameNumbersOfchildrenAfterFragmentation = The fragmentation of the element ''{0}'' change the number of its proper children
abstractFragmentationTest_dRepresentationToMoveDoesNotMatch = The DRepresentation ''{0}'' is not linked (directly or indirectly) to the object to fragment.  
abstractFragmentTest_someReferencesLost = The fragmentation does not maintain the same number of reference to the EObject ''{0}''.   
  
abstractUnfragmentTest_DefaultDescription = Perform a defragmentation on a given object.
abstractUnfragmentTest_DefaultReadableName = Defragmentation test

abstractUnfragmentTest_isNotFragmented = The element ''{0}'' is not fragmented.
abstractunfragmentTest_hasItsOwnResource =  The element ''{0}'' has just been unfragmented but it has its own eResource attribute set.

errNoProjectInitialized = Can not launch test because no project has been defined for this purpose. 
errNoAirdInitialized = Can not launch test because no aird file has been defined for this purpose.
errNoM2Initialized = Can not launch test because no 'semantic' file has been defined for this purpose.
